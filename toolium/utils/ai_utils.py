Prompt Injection cases summary:
 - Direct Attack: The user inputs a prompt that includes instructions to override the original prompt.
 - Indirect Attack: The user inputs data that, when processed by the AI, leads to unintended behavior.
 - Multilingual / obfuscated attacks: The user uses different languages or obfuscation techniques to bypass filters and manipulate the AI's behavior.
 - Concatenation Attack: The user inputs data that, when concatenated with existing prompts, alters the intended behavior.
 - Adversarial suffix: The user appends a carefully crafted suffix to the original prompt to manipulate the AI's response.
