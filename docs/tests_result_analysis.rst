Tests Result Analysis
=====================

Toolium does not create a custom tests execution report. This is delegated to your favourite test framework (unittest,
nose, pytest, lettuce, behave, ...). But Toolium provides some useful features to analyze tests results.

Logs
----

Toolium internal logs are written in *output/toolium.log*. Your tests logs can be also written in the same file using the
already existing logger instance:

.. code-block:: python

    [TestCase or PageObject]
    self.logger.debug(message)

    [Behave steps]
    context.logger.debug(message)

Screenshots
-----------

Toolium makes a screenshot when a test fails and saves it into the folder *output/screenshots/DATE_DRIVER_TYPE*.

Besides, it's possible to make a screnshot at any time during the test and it will be saved into the same folder:

.. code-block:: python

    [TestCase or PageObject]
    self.utils.capture_screenshot(screenshot_name)

    [Behave steps]
    context.utils.capture_screenshot(screenshot_name)

Videos
------

When a test fails, Toolium downloads a video of the test execution into the folder *output/videos/DATE_DRIVER_TYPE*.
This feature only works when the test has been executed in a
`Selenium Grid Extras <https://github.com/groupon/Selenium-Grid-Extras>`_ or `GGR <https://github.com/aerokube/ggr>`_
grid node. Both grids allow recording videos of test executions.

In order to download the execution video even if the test passes, configure the property *video_enabled* in *[Server]*
section in properties.cfg file ::

    [Server]
    video_enabled: true

video_enabled
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| *true*: remote video recording is enabled, a video of the test execution will be recorded and saved locally
| *false*: remote video recording is disabled


Webdriver logs
--------------

When a test fails during a remote execution, Toolium downloads webdriver logs into the folder *output*. Depending on
the driver type, the webdriver will contain different log types, for instance, *client*, *server*, *browser*, *driver*,
*performance*, *profiler*, *logcat*, *bugreport*, etc.

By default, when a test fails, toolium will download all log types available in current webdriver. But it can be also
configured to download only a set of log types setting the property `logs_types <https://toolium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/remote_configuration.html#logs-types>`_
in *[Server]* section in properties.cfg file ::

    [Server]
    logs_types: client,server

In order to download webdriver logs even if the test passes, configure the property `logs_enabled <https://toolium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/remote_configuration.html#logs-enabled>`_
in *[Server]* section in properties.cfg file ::

    [Server]
    logs_enabled: true
